# Cursor AI Assistant Rules Template

This template provides a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines for AI assistants working with modern web development projects.

To be honest a lot of it is still probably better suited to a JS meta framework type project, and entirely overkill. But it is fairly comprehensive based on setups I have seen in different projects, and my own experimentation.
